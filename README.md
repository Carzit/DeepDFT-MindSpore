# DeepDFT-MindSpore
MindSpore Implementation of the DeepDFT model for charge density prediction.  
Framework migration of `dataset.py`, `layers.py`, `densitymodel.py` from pytorch to mindspore.  

A few mistakes may happen in `densitymodel.py` duel to the grad mode limitation of MindSpore.  
(I'm not quite familiar with some features of mindspore)  
Further debugging and testing are needed.
